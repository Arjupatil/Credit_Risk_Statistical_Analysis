# Credit_Risk_Statistical_Analysis
Statistical analysis of customer financial data for credit risk assessment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a statistical analysis of customer financial and credit data to identify risk patterns and support informed loan approval decisions in the banking domain.

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze customer credit behavior using statistical techniques and translate insights into practical risk-based decision making.

## 🧾 Dataset
- Customer financial and credit attributes
- Numerical and categorical variables
- Dataset treated as anonymized/synthetic

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SciPy (statistical testing)

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Probability & Conditional Probability
- Confidence Intervals
- Hypothesis Testing:
  - One-sample t-test
  - Two-sample t-test
  - ANOVA
  - Chi-square test
  - Correlation significance test

## 📊 Key Insights
- Debt-to-Income ratio is a strong indicator of financial stress
- Credit history length alone is not statistically significant
- Loan purpose does not significantly affect credit score
- Rule-based segmentation identifies a small high-risk group
- ~99.78% customers qualify for safe auto-approval

## 🏦 Business Impact
- Supports automated loan approval with risk controls
- Reduces manual review workload
- Enables data-driven credit policy decisions

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Analysis is statistical and rule-based
- No default outcome data for predictive modeling
- Credit score treated as a numerical risk index

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Predictive modeling using logistic regression
- Risk scorecard development
- Model validation with default data
